# Structrue of sentence
* Thus, approximations are necessary; **the higher the complexity** of a system and the longer the time span of the processes of interest **is, the more severe the required approximations are**.(Source from the first chapter of gromacs manual)
* But this is not enough to compute thermodynamic equilibrium properties that are based on free energies, **such as** phase equilibria, binding constants, solubilities, relative stability of molecular conformations, **etc**.(Source from the first chapter of gromacs manual)
* **This item is mentioned last because it is the least of the evils.** (Source from the first chapter of gromacs manual)
* To make a good decision, you should read the literature for how people have simulated systems similar to yours, and see how good their results were. Then read up on how that force field was derived, and what people have said about it since then. **If your choice of model physics is random, so will your results be!** 
# Word
* The prominent ultrafast component observed in both atomic and molecular solutes should **have a profound effect on** aqueous reaction dynamics (source from paper _Femtosecond solvation dynamics of water_).
* New one coming
